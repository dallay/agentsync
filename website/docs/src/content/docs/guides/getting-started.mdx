`agentsync` is a fast, portable CLI tool for synchronizing AI agent configurations across multiple coding assistants using symbolic links.

## Installation

### Node.js Package Managers (Recommended)

If you have Node.js (>=18) installed, the easiest way to install AgentSync is through a package manager.

#### Global Installation

```bash

# Using npm

npm install -g @dallay/agentsync

# Using pnpm

pnpm add -g @dallay/agentsync

# Using yarn (Classic v1)

yarn global add @dallay/agentsync

# Using bun

bun i -g @dallay/agentsync
```

#### One-off Execution

```bash

# Using npx (npm)

npx @dallay/agentsync apply

# Using dlx (pnpm)

pnpm dlx @dallay/agentsync apply

# Using dlx (yarn v2+)

yarn dlx @dallay/agentsync apply

# Using bunx (bun)

bunx @dallay/agentsync apply
```

### From GitHub Releases

Download the latest release for your platform:

#### macOS (Apple Silicon)

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/dallay/agentsync/releases/latest/download/agentsync-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
tar xzf agentsync-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
sudo mv agentsync-*/agentsync /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Linux (x86_64)

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/dallay/agentsync/releases/latest/download/agentsync-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
tar xzf agentsync-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
sudo mv agentsync-*/agentsync /usr/local/bin/
```

### From Source (Requires Rust 1.89+)

If you have Rust installed, you can install directly from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/agentsync) or from the repository:

```bash

# From crates.io

cargo install agentsync

# From GitHub

cargo install --git https://github.com/dallay/agentsync
```

## Basic Usage

### 1. Initialize Configuration

#### New Projects

Run `init` in your project root to create the default structure:

```bash
agentsync init
```

This creates a `.agents/` directory with an initial `agentsync.toml` and an `AGENTS.md` file.

#### Existing Projects with Agent Files

If you already have agent configuration files (like `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/`, or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`), use the interactive wizard:

```bash
agentsync init --wizard
```

The wizard will:
1. Scan your project for existing agent-related files
2. Let you select which files to migrate to `.agents/`
3. Optionally create backups of your original files (with confirmation)
4. Generate a configuration that manages everything with symlinks

This makes it easy to transition from manual file management to AgentSync!

### 2. Configure your Agents

Edit `.agents/agentsync.toml` to define which assistants you use. By default, it includes configurations for Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Codex CLI, and a root AGENTS.md target.

```toml
[agents.claude]
enabled = true

# ... configuration ...

```

### 3. Apply Symlinks

Create the symbolic links in your project root:

```bash
agentsync apply
```

This will create files like `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` that point back to your single source of truth in `.agents/`.

### 4. Integration with pnpm/npm

We recommend adding the apply command to your `prepare` script to ensure symlinks are always present for your team:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "agentsync apply || true"
  }
}
```

> **Note:** `|| true` ensures the install process does not fail if `agentsync` is not yet installed, such as on a fresh clone or in CI environments.
