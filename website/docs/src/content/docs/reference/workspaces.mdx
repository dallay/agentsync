`agentsync` is a multi-language project that combines a high-performance Rust core with a TypeScript distribution layer.

## Repository Structure

- `src/`: Core logic and CLI implementation in **Rust**.
- `npm/agentsync/`: **TypeScript** wrapper used for NPM distribution.
- `website/docs/`: Documentation site built with **Starlight**.
- `website/`: Main project website.
- `tests/`: Integration tests for the CLI.

---

## Rust Workspace (The Core)

The core logic is written in Rust for speed, safety, and easy distribution as a single binary.

- **Tools**: Cargo
- **Version**: Rust 1.85+ (Edition 2024)
- **Key Commands**:
  ```bash
  cargo build    # Build debug binary
  cargo test     # Run unit and integration tests
  cargo run      # Run the CLI locally
  ```
- **Error Handling**: Uses `thiserror` for custom errors and `anyhow` for application-level error handling.

## JavaScript Workspace (Distribution)

The JS workspace acts as a wrapper to provide an easy installation path via `pnpm/npm`. It manages platform-specific binary downloads.

- **Tools**: pnpm, TypeScript
- **Location**: `npm/agentsync/`
- **Key Commands**:
  ```bash
  pnpm run typecheck  # Verify types
  pnpm run build      # Compile TypeScript to JS
  ```
- **Strictness**: We enforce strict TypeScript configurations. Avoid `any` at all costs.

---

## Modern Tooling

We enforce the use of modern CLI tools for development. If you don't have them, we recommend installing them:
- `bat`: Syntax-highlighted file viewing (replaces `cat`).
- `rg` (ripgrep): Fast recursive search (replaces `grep`).
- `fd`: Simple and fast alternative to `find`.
- `sd`: Intuitive find and replace (replaces `sed`).
- `eza`: Feature-rich directory listing (replaces `ls`).
