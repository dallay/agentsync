## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in this project, please
report it privately so we can investigate and remediate it before public
disclosure.

Reporting options (preferred order):

- Open a private Security Advisory on GitHub for this repository: go to
  "Security" → "Advisories" → "Create new draft advisory" and follow the
  prompts. This lets us track the issue privately and (optionally) request a
  CVE.
- Email: security@dallay.org (use a GPG‑encrypted message if you prefer).

What to include in your report
- Affected version(s) of agentsync.
- A clear description of the issue and the security impact.
- Reproduction steps and a minimal PoC (if available).
- Any relevant logs, configuration, or environment information.
- Your contact information and whether you are reporting as an individual or
  on behalf of an organization.

Response commitments
- Acknowledgement: within 48 hours of receiving your report (business days).
- Initial triage: within 7 calendar days with an estimated remediation plan.
- Updates: we will provide status updates at least weekly until resolved, or
  more frequently for critical issues.

Disclosure process
- We will coordinate disclosure with the reporter. Our goal is to publish a
  public advisory once a fix is available and users can upgrade. If a
  coordinated disclosure is not possible, we will provide a responsible
  disclosure timeline (typically no longer than 90 days) before public
  disclosure unless a longer window is required for a complex fix.

Confidentiality and safe harbor
- We ask reporters to avoid public disclosure (including PoCs) until a fix is
  available or disclosure is coordinated with the project maintainers.
- We welcome and appreciate responsible security research. We will not pursue
  legal action against good‑faith security researchers acting in accordance
  with these guidelines.

If you need faster handling for a high‑severity issue, please indicate that in
your report and provide the best way to contact you securely.
