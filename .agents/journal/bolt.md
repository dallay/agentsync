## 2024-05-20 - Iterative vs. Recursive Glob Matching

**Learning:** A recursive glob pattern matching function with `*` wildcards was causing significant performance issues due to repeated string allocations and deep recursion. Replacing it with an iterative, backtracking algorithm using `char` iterators eliminated these bottlenecks.

**Action:** When implementing pattern matching or similar "search" algorithms, prefer iterative solutions with backtracking over recursive ones to avoid performance overhead and potential stack overflows.
